###What Does It Do?

Harmonize is an App that aids aspiring musicians in creating chord progressions. Users are able to pick a starting note and chord quality and from there are given suggestions on what chord or chords would make sense musically to go to next. I created these suggestions based on popular chord progressions that have been used in pop/rock over the years. Users are able to choose 4 chords and save 4 chord progressions that they make to their profile if logged in. Designed with mobile in mind, I decided to go with a simple design that was easy use and navigate. I hope this apps serves as an inspiration for those who have always wanted to write songs, but felt limited by their lack of music theory.
