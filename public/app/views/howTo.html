			<li class='white'><h4>See The Keyboard Above? Notice Something?</h4>
				<p class='green'>The Keyboard is Made Up of 12 Notes that repeat over and over again. They are C, C#/Db, D, D#/Eb, E, F, F#/Gb, G, G#/Ab, A, A#/Bb, and B. You may be wondering why some notes have two names. These are called enharmonic notes and the name assigned depends on what key you are playing in. For now don't worry about that. For this app, I have used all flat enharmonic names. So we are working with C, Db, D, Eb, E, F, Gb, G, Ab, A, Bb, and B.</p>
			</li>
			<li class='white'><h4>This App Uses Major and Minor Triads, With One Exception:</h4>
				<p class='green'>A Triad is a chord that contains 3 notes. Chords ending in "M" are major and chords ending in "m" are minor. Each Triad consists of a root note, a third, and a 5th. These are the intervals from the root. The only difference between major and minor Triads is that a minor Triad has a minor 3rd and a major Triad has a major 3rd. The exception that you will find is a dim chord (short for diminished). A diminished chord has a root, a flat fifth, and a flat third.</p>
			</li>
			<li class='white'><h4>Triads are Easy to Make</h4>
				<p class='green'>Notes are seperated by half steps. To make a major chord all you need to do is start at the root, count up 4 half steps to the 3rd and then 3 half steps to the 5th, and presto! You have a chord! For example if we start at C, and want to create a major Traid then E would be the 3rd and G would be the 5th. To make it a C minor Triad all we have to do is lower the 3rd a half-step tp Eb and we have a C minor Triad. For a dim chord take a minor chord and lower the 5th a half step.</p>
